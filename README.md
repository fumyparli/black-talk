this is web-chat open source.

this app was made using "express + mysql(sequelize)". 

you can use this app by "git clone https://github.com/fumyparli/black-talk".

you have to set up '.env' as the file below.

<pre>
<code>
COOKIE_SECRET=put your cookie_secret
SEQUELIZE_PASSWORD=put your sequelize_password
</code>
</pre>

you have to modify "my_ip" to your server ip in "views/chat.html"

ex) const my_ip = http://localhost:80";

then, you can run this app by typing "npm run dev" for develop mode or "npm start" for production mode.

If you just want to experience it, you can do in http://35.225.236.149
